# wordpress-admin-scrapping

A simple scraper using puppeteer for gathering Wordpress registered users' custom data.

I created it because of the plugin "groups", which has terrible exporting options -- and I needed to export only my paid subscribers.

## How to use:

Change the urls to your desired destination, and modify the query parameters to meet your requirements.

Also change the information that you want to extract from the page.

If you already know web scraping, I think that this script is too simple for you. But if it happens that you don't know scraping, you will see that it is very easy and you will learn how to do simple ones -- or just use this one that I made.
